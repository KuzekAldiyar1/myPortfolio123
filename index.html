                <p>Hey everyone! I'm Kuzek Aldiyar, a 15-year-old student at NSPM School. I'm super passionate about tech and robots, always exploring the amazing things they can do.

                    When I'm not coding or building bots, you'll find me shooting hoops or kicking a ball on the field, where I love to play and learn teamwork. I'm also learning German, hoping to connect with people worldwide.</p>

                    <p style="margin-left: 50px;">In 2022, in the 8th grade, I enrolled in NSPM, and that's when a different life began. I met many people, including Kuanysh, where I truly discovered another aspect of computer science.</p>

                    <p>Actually when in the 8th grade we approached with a new topic called HTML and CSS I really started to think about doing the websites and in the end I created a site about different perfumes which are one of the best in the world</p>

                        <p style="margin-left: 50px;">Growing , I approached with Robotics when I was about 9-10 years old. But right now when I met another Robotics from FIRST I realized that how much it was cool and great to learn and gain a new skills. Then I with my team won a quota to CAFC 2024 where we unfortunantely were placed 25th of 55 teams. Not bad but not good)</p>

                        <p>In the 7-8th grades I thought and decided to learn German language because in the nearest future I would really like studying abroad and decided that my main point will be Germany. So at the moment I've passed A2.1 course and in the summer I plan to go to B1 so we will see!!!</p>
